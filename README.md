# DaveWatcher

Hundreds of millions of smartphones are thrown out each year. Many of these could have avoided landfill or recycling if they were repurposed.

DaveWatcher is a home security app that uses machine learning to detect human and animal motion inside a home. It can be installed on any Android device with a camera.
DaveWatcher turns phones (preferrably old unused phones) into security cameras. The app uses machine learning to detect motion in the video. It is capable of distinguishing between human and non-human motion.

When motion is detected, the camera phone sends a notification to the control centre device - this would be a phone that the user carries around with them. This form of security system is extremely low cost, as it notifies the user directly when motion is detected. A system like this could divert millions of phones from landfill by repurposing them as security systems.
